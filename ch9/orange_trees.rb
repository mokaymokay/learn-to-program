# Make an OrangeTree class that contains a height method which returns its height,
# and a oneYearPasses method, which, when called, ages the tree one year. Each year
# the tree grows taller, and after some number of years, the tree should die.
# It only starts producing fruits after a few years of growing, and older trees
# produce more each year than younger trees. Also, create methods countTheOranges
# (which returns the number of oranges on the tree) and pickAnOrange (which reduces
# the @orangeCount by one and returns a string telling the user how delicious the
# orange was, or else it just says that there are no more oranges to pick this
# year). Any oranges that aren't picked fall off before the next year.
